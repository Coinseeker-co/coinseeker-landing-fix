  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">2. Why the Company Collects and Processes Data</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">The Company collects and processes Personal Data for the
      following
      reasons:</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(a) performing our agreement with you to provide content and
      services, including providing, improving, and developing our services;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(b) researching, designing, and launching new features or
      products;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(c) providing you with alerts, updates, materials, or information
      about our services or&nbsp; other types of information that you requested or signed up
      to;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(d) collecting overdue amounts;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(e) responding or taking part in legal proceedings, including
      seeking professional&nbsp; advice, or for the legitimate and legal interests of the
      Company or
      a third party (e.g. the interests of our other customers);&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(f) compliance with legal obligations that we are subject
      to;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(g) communicating with you and responding to your questions or
      requests;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(h) direct marketing - we require your consent specifically for
      this purpose and you may opt-out any time;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(i) purposes directly related or incidental to the above;
      or</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(j) where you have given consent to it.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">These reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data
      determine
      and limit what Personal Data we collect and how we use it (section 3. below), how long
      we
      store it (section 4. below), who has access to it (section 5. below) and what rights and
      other
      control mechanisms are available to you as a user (section 6. below).</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">3. What Data We Collect and Process</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">3.1 Basic Account Data</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">When setting up an Account, the Company will collect your email
      address and country of residence. You are also required to choose a user name and a
      password.
      The provision of this information is necessary to register a User Account. You are
      responsible
      for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with
      anyone.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">During setup of your account, the account is automatically
      assigned
      a number (the &quot;ID&quot;) that is later used to reference your user account without
      directly exposing Personally-Identifying Information about you.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">3.2 Transaction and Payment Data</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">In order to make a transaction online, you may need to provide
      payment data to the Company to enable the transaction. If you pay by credit card, you
      need to
      provide typical credit card information (name, address, credit card number, expiration
      date,
      and security code) to the Company, which the Company will process and transmit to the
      payment
      service provider of your choice to enable the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks.
      Likewise, the Company will receive data from your payment service provider for the same
      reasons.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">3.3 Other Data You Explicitly Submit</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">We will collect and process Personal Data whenever you explicitly
      provide it to us or send it as part of communication with others, e.g. in forums, chats,

  </p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(a) Information that you post, comment or follow in any of our
      Content and Services;</span></p>

  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(c) Information you provide when you request information or
      support
      from us or purchase Content and Services from us, including information necessary to
      process
      your orders with the relevant payment merchant or, in case of physical goods, shipping
      providers;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(d) Information you provide to us when participating in
      competitions, contests, and tournaments or responding to surveys, e.g. your contact
      details.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">3.4 Your Use of the Websites</span></p>

      merger
      we may transfer Personal Data to the relevant or proposed transferees of our operations
      (or a
      substantial part thereof) in any part of the world.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">5.2 We may also share your Personal Data with our third party
      providers that provide customer support services in connection with goods, Content and

      agents,
      advisers, auditors, contractors, financial institutions, and service providers in

      the processing of your payment and the provision of support services); persons under a
      duty of
      confidentiality to us; or persons to whom we are required to make disclosure under
      applicable
      laws and regulations in any part of the world.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">5.4 In accordance with internet standards, we may also share
      certain information (including your IP address and the identification of content you
      wish to
      access) with our third party network providers that provide content delivery network
      services
      and server services in connection with us. Our content delivery network providers enable
      the
      delivery of digital content you have requested, by using a system of distributed servers
      that
      deliver the content to you, based on your geographic location.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">5.5 The Company may allow you to link your User Account to an
      account offered by a third party. If you consent to link the accounts, the Company may
      collect
      and combine information you allowed the Company to receive from a third party with
      information
      of your User Account to the degree allowed by your consent at the time. If the linking
      of the
      accounts requires the transmission of information about your person from the Company to
      a
      third party, you will be informed about it before the linking takes place and you will
      be
      given the opportunity to consent to the linking and the transmission of your
      information. The
      third party&#39;s use of your information will be subject to the third party&#39;s
      privacy
      policy, which we encourage you to review.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">5.6 The Company may release Personal Data to comply with court
      orders or laws and regulations that require us to disclose such information.</span></p>

      message
      to a board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made
      publicly
      available online; therefore, you are doing so at your own risk; and that such
      information can
      be collected, correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited
      messages from
      other posters or third parties and these activities are beyond our control. If your

  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">6. Your Rights and Control Mechanisms</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">You have the right to:</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(a) check whether we hold personal data about you;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(b) access any personal data we hold about you;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(c) require us to correct any inaccuracy or error in any personal
      data we hold about you;</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">(d) request for the deletion of your personal data through the
      deletion of the user account.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">The data protection laws of the European Economic Area and other
      territories grant their citizens certain rights in relation to their Personal Data.
      While
      other jurisdictions may provide fewer statutory rights to their citizens, we make the
      tools
      designed to exercise such rights available to our customers worldwide.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">As a resident of the European Economic Area you have the
      following
      rights in relation to your Personal Data:</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">6.1 Right of Access</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold
      about
      you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data
      is
      retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can
      use
      the right to access your Personal Data through the Privacy Dashboard. If the request
      affects
      the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve
      the
      right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of
      providing
      the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the
      request.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">6.2 Right to Rectification</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">If we process your Personal Data, we shall endeavour to ensure by
      implementing suitable measures that your Personal Data is accurate and up-to-date for
      the
      purposes for which it was collected. If your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete,
      you
      can change the information you provided via the Privacy Dashboard.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">6.3. Right to Erasure</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data
      concerning you by deleting your User Account via the support page.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">As a result of deleting your User Account, you will lose access
      to
      services, including the User Account, Subscriptions and service-related information
      linked to
      the User Account and the possibility to access other services you are using the User
      Account
      for.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">We allow you to restore your User Account during a grace period
      of
      30 (thirty) days from the moment you request deletion of your User Account. This
      functionality
      allows you not to lose your account by mistake, because of your loss of your account
      credentials or due to hacking. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize
      financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the User
      Account
      deletion request. After the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account
      will be
      deleted subject to section 4. above.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">In some cases, deletion of your User Account, and therefore
      Personal Data deletion, is complicated. In some cases, considering the complexity and
      number
      of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer
      than
      two further months.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">6.4 Right to Object</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">When our processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate
      interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR / section 2.c) of this Privacy
      Policy, you
      have the right to object to this processing. If you object we will no longer process
      your
      Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the
      processing
      as described in Article 21 of the GDPR; in particular if the data is necessary for the
      establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory
      authority.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">7. Children</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">The minimum age to create a User Account is 18. the Company will
      not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under this age. Insofar as certain
      countries
      apply a higher age of consent for the collection of Personal Data, the Company requires
      parental consent before a User Account can be created and Personal Data associated with
      it
      collected. The Company encourages parents to instruct their children to never give out
      personal information when online.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">8. Contact Info</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c2">You can contact the Company&#39;s data protection officer at the
